## About The Project

Breedle is a Wordle-style web game where the player must guess the dog breed based on an image.
You have 6 attempts to guess correctly.
Each guess gives feedback:

- 🟩 Correct letter & correct position
- 🟨 Correct letter but wrong position
- ⬜ Letter not in the word

The image reveals more clearly as the guesses progress.
