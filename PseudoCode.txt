1- There will be input bar that you put the guesses of what you are currently looking at ( random picture depending on topic which I'm making is a game reference).

2- Keyboard layout that will show the "letters used that are not included in the word".

3- A picture hint that zooms out each time you use 2 guesses and would fully zoom out at 4th guess and is a total of 6 guesses.

4- History bar showcasing the already typed words "Creating an element in JavaScript that'll be fun".
